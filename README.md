# How to run the catalog (instructions for developers)

- The catalogue runs on `Vue 3`, so you need to prepare your local environment.
- We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.
- The database file is located at the path: `public/db.json`

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Volar Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (also you need to disable Vetur, if you are using it) 
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

If you need to change the settings, see the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
